**Open source eye tracking platform.**

Pupil is a project in active, community driven development. Pupil Core mobile eye tracking hardware is accessible, hackable, and affordable. The software is open source and written in `Python` and `C++` when speed is an issue.

Our vision is to create tools for a diverse group of people interested in learning about eye tracking and conducting their eye tracking projects.

## Users
[Download the latest apps](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/releases/latest "Download Pupil Capture, Pupil Player, and Pupil Service application bundles")! 

You don't need to know how to write code to _use_ Pupil. Read the [Pupil Core user guide](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/ "Pupil Core user guide"). 

## Developers
There are a number of ways you can interact with Pupil Core software as a developer:

- [Use the API](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/developer/core/network-api/): Use the network based real-time API to communicate with Pupil over the network and integrate with your application. 
- [Develop a Plugin](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/developer/core/plugin-api/): Plugins are loaded at runtime from the app bundle. Note: if your plugin requires Python libraries that are not included in the application bundle, then you will need to run from source. 
- [Run from Source](#installing-dependencies): Can't do what you need to do with the network based api or plugin? Then get ready to dive into the inner workings of Pupil and run from source!

All setup and dependency installation instructions are contained in this repo. All other developer documentation is [here](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/developer/core "Pupil Core developer docs").
