# Dependencies for Ubuntu 17.10 or lower

These installation instructions are tested from **Ubuntu 16.04** to **Ubuntu 17.10** running on many machines. Do not run Pupil on a VM unless you know what you are doing. We recommend using **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** though as the setup is much easier! See the corresponding setup guide for [Ubuntu 18.04](./dependencies-ubuntu18.md).


## General Setup

Pupil requires Python 3.6 or higher. Please check this [resource](https://askubuntu.com/questions/865554/how-do-i-install-python-3-6-using-apt-get) on how to install Python 3.6 on your version of Ubuntu.

## ffmpeg3

Install ffmpeg3 from jonathonf's ppa:

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/ffmpeg-3
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install -y libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libavresample-dev ffmpeg libav-tools x264 x265 libportaudio2 portaudio19-dev
```

## OpenCV

You will need to install OpenCV from source:

**NOTE:** Opencv needs to following requirements set up correctly for being able to build correctly! If you don't have these set up correctly, you might be able to build OpenCV, but experience errors when trying to use it with Pupil!
1. **python3** interpreter can be found
2. __libpython***.so__ shared lib can be found (make sure to install python3-dev)
3. **numpy** for python3 is installed

If everything is set up correctly, run the following commands in the terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv
cd opencv
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DWITH_TBB=ON -DWITH_CUDA=OFF -DBUILD_opencv_python2=OFF -DBUILD_opencv_python3=ON ..
make -j2
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

**NOTE:** OpenCV is not able to build Python 2 and Python 3 modules at the same time. OpenCV will build the Python 2 module by default if requirements for both versions are met. Setting the Python 2 Numpy include directory to an empty string effectively disables the Python 2 module build.

### OpenCV Troubleshooting

The following errors were commonly reported:

* `ImportError: No module named 'cv2'`

  When you see this error, **do not install opencv-python via pip!** If you did so, uninstall it again! The error appears if the above requisites were not met. Delete the build folder, recheck the requisites and try again.

* `ImportError: */detector_2d.*.so: undefined symbol: *ellipse*InputOutputArray*RotatedRect*Scalar*`
  
  This error appears if opencv has been installed previously via **apt-get**.
  * Remove all opencv installations that were installed via **apt-get**.
  * Delete the __*.so__ files as well as the **build** dirctory within the **pupil_detectors** directory.
  * Start Pupil Capture. This should trigger a recompilation of the detector modules.


## Turbojpeg

```sh
wget -O libjpeg-turbo.tar.gz https://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg-turbo/files/1.5.1/libjpeg-turbo-1.5.1.tar.gz/download
tar xvzf libjpeg-turbo.tar.gz
cd libjpeg-turbo-1.5.1
./configure --enable-static=no --prefix=/usr/local
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

## Custom Version of libusb for 200hz cameras

This is **ONLY** required if you are using 200hz cameras. Otherwise it can be ignored!

1. Build or download fixed binary from release: https://github.com/pupil-labs/libusb/releases/tag/v1.0.21-rc6-fixes
1. Replace system libusb-1.0.so.0 with this binary.

## libuvc
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pupil-labs/libuvc
cd libuvc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make && sudo make install
```

If you want to run libuvc as normal user, add the following udev rules:
```sh
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb",  ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0664"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/10-libuvc.rules > /dev/null
sudo udevadm trigger
```

## 3D Eye Model Dependencies
```sh
sudo apt install -y libgoogle-glog-dev libatlas-base-dev libeigen3-dev
```

## Ceres

You will need to build Ceres from source:
```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bzindovic/suitesparse-bugfix-1319687
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsuitesparse-dev
```

If `add-apt-repository` is not found, install the following package first:
```sh
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
```

The build and install the Ceres solver:
```sh
git clone https://ceres-solver.googlesource.com/ceres-solver
cd ceres-solver
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
make -j3
make test
sudo make install
sudo sh -c 'echo "/usr/local/lib" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ceres.conf'
sudo ldconfig
```

### Install Python Libraries

We recommend using a virtual environment with a valid installation of Python 3.6 or higher.

```sh
pip install cysignals
pip install cython
pip install msgpack==0.5.6
pip install numexpr
pip install packaging
pip install psutil
pip install pyaudio
pip install pyopengl
pip install pyzmq
pip install scipy
pip install torch torchvision
pip install git+https://github.com/zeromq/pyre

pip install pupil_apriltags
pip install git+https://github.com/pupil-labs/PyAV
pip install git+https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyuvc
pip install git+https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyndsi
pip install git+https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyglui
pip install git+https://github.com/pupil-labs/nslr
pip install git+https://github.com/pupil-labs/nslr-hmm
```

## Next Steps

That's it! You're done installing dependencies!

Now, you should be able to run Pupil from source. Follow the remaining instructions in the [README](../README.md).
