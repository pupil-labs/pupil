"""
Contains classes to announce available data between different plugins. Data (e.g.
pupil positions or gaze) is produced by some plugins and consumed by others. Data
consumers need to know if data producers provide new data or if the data producer
changed (e.g. the user switched from Pupil From Recording to Offline Pupil Detection)

This module provides an Announcer that can be used by producers and a Listener that
can be used by consumers.

All announced data has a unique token, so Listeners know if they receive multiple
announcements for the same data and can ignore redundant announcements.
