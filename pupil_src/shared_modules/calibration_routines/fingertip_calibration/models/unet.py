    The U-Net is a convolutional encoder-decoder neural network.
    Contextual spatial information (from the decoding,
    expansive pathway) about an input tensor is merged with
    information representing the localization of details
    (from the encoding, compressive pathway).

    Modifications to the original paper:
    (1) padding is used in 3x3 convolutions to prevent loss
        of border pixels
    (2) merging outputs does not require cropping due to (1)
    (3) residual connections can be used by specifying
        UNet(merge_mode='add')
    (4) if non-parametric upsampling is used in the decoder
        pathway (specified by upmode='upsample'), then an
        additional 1x1 2d convolution occurs after upsampling
        to reduce channel dimensionality by a factor of 2.
